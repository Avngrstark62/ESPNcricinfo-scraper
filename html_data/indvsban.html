                      bowled him! Didn't pick the length there at all. Or took a chance and it didn't come off. Goes very deep in his crease, and across, to one on the fuller side of a length, angling away from the stumps and only straightening slightly. Wants to work it through the leg side - it's a bedrock of his game - but on this occasion it hits his inside edge and cannons into the stumps

                      taken, and he made a tricky catch look simple there. Shubman Gill makes everything look simple. Kuldeep goes hard, into the pitch with this stock ball that turns sharply into Mendis and cramps him a little on the pull. Goes hard at it, swivelling his hip into the shot, and hits it in the air, but he can't quite clear the fielder at long-on. Gill catches it two-handed over his head while stepping backwards, his feet inches from the rope, then he flicks the ball up, steps over the rope and back into the field of play, and catches the ball again

                      He comes down the track, but Theekshana sees him coming. Drags the length back with one that dips, and it's the offbreak as well which grips and spins away. Pant is in no man's land and Mendis wastes little time in whipping off the bails

                      Rohit looks to slog sweep this from well outside off, but this deeps and the length isn't quite there. The ball also turns away, and just about catches the edge on the bottom of the bat. Mendis completes an excellent catch behind the stumps

                      but this looked mighty close. It was the arm ball pitching around off. Kohli comes forward and plays for turn that isn't there and is struck flush on the front pad. Three reds confirms the bad news for Kohli, and he must depart

                      five down, that's big turn! And I think Axar misread that too. It wasn't short, but it may have been short enough to cut if the line had been wider. As it was, though, Wellalage didn't angle this that far across the left-hander, and on this pitch, you don't want to be committing to cut something from such a straight line. No room to adjust, no time either because it turns quickly, and past his inside edge to crash into leg stump

                      big appeal for lbw, and it's given! Did that straighten enough? Flat length ball angling into the stumps, and then Iyer, looking to work it leg side off the back foot, is beaten on the inside edge, beaten by lack of turn. It does straighten, though, just not as much as Iyer expected.

                      ... It pitches on middle and leg, it struck him on the front pad - he'd opened up to access the leg side - in front of leg stump, but because he'd opened up like that, he was deep in his crease at the time of impact and the ball didn't have that far to travel. It was going on to hit leg stump according to ball-tracking, and India are six down

                      and there's the fifth! And there is Sri Lanka's first bilateral ODI series win over India since August 1997! Tossed up, angling across, and it either skids on with the angle after pitching within the stumps or straightens ever so slightly. Goes hard at the sweep, and it turns in to beat him and strike his back leg. Given out, and India have no reviews left. Kuldeep was unlucky there. That didn't turn back enough to hit off stump, going by replays.

                      oh no, that's not a good leave. That's a good-length ball angling into the stumps, and yes, it's the attempted legbreak, and the seam position suggests it should turn away and miss the stumps, but there's a lot of natural variation on offer. Just shoulders arms and this ball hits not just off stump but a chunk of middle too

                      gone, and hje can't review even if he'd like to! Down the track, realises he's not to the pitch of this flighted legbreak, and sinks onto his back knee to have a slog-sweep at it. Misses, is hit on the back thigh, and Ruchira Palliyaguruge gives it out immediately. Brave decision, because he's down the track on a turning pitch, but we'll know better when we see ball-tracking. It straightened, and it didn't turn a lot, but it still had a long way to travel. Well, ball-tracking says that pitched on off and middle and was turning to hit a good part of middle stump
